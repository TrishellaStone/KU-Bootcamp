## Unit 11 Submission File: Network Security Homework 

### Part 1: Review Questions 

#### Security Control Types

The concept of defense in depth can be broken down into three different security control types. Identify the security control type of each set  of defense tactics.

1. Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?

    Answer: Physical

2. Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?

    Answer: Administrative

3. Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?

    Answer: Technical

#### Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators

1. What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?

    Answer: IDS monitors the network for dangerous activity and alerts the administrator. IPS can detect an attack and then act on it. IPS can reject packets and give commands.

2. What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?

   Answer: Indicator of Attacks is happenign in real time. Indicator of Compromise is an after an attack/breach. It gathers data from what occurred and then that info is used to help strengthen a network.

#### The Cyber Kill Chain

Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.

1. Stage 1: Recon: Choosing the target and conducting in-depth research

2. Stage 2: Weaponization: Creation of malware weapon to exploit vulnerabilities

3. Stage 3: Delivery: Transmitting the weapon to the target

4. Stage 4: Exploitation: The malware is triggered to exploit the target

5. Stage 5: Installation: Malware creates the access point for the intruder. The "Backdoor".

6. Stage 6: Command and Control. This gives intruder access to the network

7. Stage 7: Exfiltration: The intruder fullfils their purpose such as collecting data, destroying data, ransom, etc.


#### Snort Rule Analysis

Use the Snort rule to answer the following questions:

Snort Rule #1

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

   Answer: Alerts user of inbound TCP from ports 5800 through 5820

2. What stage of the Cyber Kill Chain does this alert violate?

   Answer: Recon

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

   Answer: VNC Scan

Snort Rule #2

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP"; flow:established,to_client; flowbits:isnotset,ET.http.binary; flowbits:isnotset,ET.INFO.WindowsUpdate; file_data; content:"MZ"; within:2; byte_jump:4,58,relative,little; content:"PE|00 00|"; distance:-64; within:4; flowbits:set,ET.http.binary; metadata: former_category POLICY; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018959; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2018959; rev:4; metadata:created_at 2014_08_19, updated_at 2017_02_01;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

   Answer: Alerts the user when there is any TCP traffic to the home network

2. What layer of the Defense in Depth model does this alert violate?

   Answer: Technical

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

   Answer: Policy violation with a file download

Snort Rule #3

- Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port 4444 to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the `msg` in the Rule Option.

    Answer: alert tcp any port 4444 -> home_net any (msg: "TCP packet detected")

### Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab

#### Log into the Azure `firewalld` machine

Log in using the following credentials:

- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

#### Uninstall `ufw`

Before getting started, you should verify that you do not have any instances of `ufw` running. This will avoid conflicts with your `firewalld` service. This also ensures that `firewalld` will be your default firewall.

- Run the command that removes any running instance of `ufw`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt -y remove ufw
    ```

#### Enable and start `firewalld`

By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:

- Run the commands that enable and start `firewalld` upon boots and reboots.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld
    ```

  Note: This will ensure that `firewalld` remains active after each reboot.

#### Confirm that the service is running.

- Run the command that checks whether or not the `firewalld` service is up and running.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --state
    ```


#### List all firewall rules currently configured.

Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.

- Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
    ```

- Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.

#### List all supported service types that can be enabled.

- Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-services
    ```

- We can see that the `Home` and `Drop` Zones are created by default.


#### Zone Views

- Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
    ```

- We can see that the `Public` and `Drop` Zones are created by default. Therefore, we will need to create Zones for `Web`, `Sales`, and `Mail`.

#### Create Zones for `Web`, `Sales` and `Mail`.

- Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Web
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Sales
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Mail
    ```

#### Set the zones to their designated interfaces:

- Run the commands that sets your `eth` interfaces to your zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Web --change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Sales --change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Mail --change-interface=eth0
    
    ```

#### Add services to the active zones:

- Run the commands that add services to the **public** zone, the **web** zone, the **sales** zone, and the **mail** zone.

- Public:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=smtp
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=pop3

    ```

- Web:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http

    ```

- Sales

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https

    ```

- Mail

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=smtp
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=pop3

- What is the status of `http`, `https`, `smtp` and `pop3`?

#### Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.

- Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone.

     ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-source=
    ```

#### Make rules permanent then reload them:

It's good practice to ensure that your `firewalld` installation remains nailed up and retains its services across reboots. This ensure that the network remains secured after unplanned outages such as power failures.

- Run the command that reloads the `firewalld` configurations and writes it to memory

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

#### View active Zones

Now, we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently **active** zones. This a good time to verify your zone settings.

- Run the command that displays all zone services.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
    ```


#### Block an IP address

- Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address `138.138.0.3`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="138.138.0.3" reject
    ```

#### Block Ping/ICMP Requests

Harden your network against `ping` scans by blocking `icmp ehco` replies.

- Run the command that blocks `pings` and `icmp` requests in your `public` zone.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-icmp-block=echo-reply --add-icmp-block=echo-request
    ```

#### Rule Check

Now that you've set up your brand new `firewalld` installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.

- Run the command that lists all  of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.

    ```bash
   $ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all>
   $ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --list-all>
   $ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --list-all>
   $ <sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --list-all>
   $ <sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --list-all>


(NOTE: My Firewalld terminal was not working correctly. At one point it told me it encountered an error and asked me to send this off. I googled it and people suggested trying sudo firewall-cmd --reload. The first time, it showed my newly created zones. I then did the eth0 commands, it would tell me success but when checking active zones, my zones would not show. Garret and I both also shut down our machines to reset them, it did the same thing)


Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive `firewalld` installation.
